# SECR1013-DIGITAL-LOGIC

### Reflection of this course
Studying digital logic in class was like unlocking the secret mechanisms of our electronics. We investigated Boolean algebra and binary numbers, which was like to studying a coded language of ones and zeros. Building basic circuits was similar to going on a hands-on technological journey. The internal workings of the common devices we use are fascinating to learn about. I now feel more a part of the technology we utilize on a daily basis because of this topic.
